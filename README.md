# 🦜 Indian Birds Classifier

The **Indian Birds Classifier** is a deep learning–based image classification project designed to identify bird species native to India from images.  
This project was **developed and trained on Kaggle**, utilizing **Kaggle’s free GPU environment (up to 30 hours per week)** for efficient model training and experimentation.

The system allows users to upload bird images and receive accurate species predictions using a trained convolutional neural network / transfer learning model.
